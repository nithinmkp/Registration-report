abstract = {Unexpected inflation devalues nominal government bonds. It must therefore correspond to a decline in expected future surpluses, or a rise in their discount rates, so that the real value of debt equals the present value of surpluses. I measure each component using a vector autoregression, via responses to inflation, recession, surplus and discount rate shocks. Discount rates account for much inflation variation, for the cyclical pattern of inflation, and why persistent deficits often do not cause inflation. Long-term debt is important. In response to a fiscal shock, smooth inflation slowly devalues outstanding long-term bonds.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Post-Great Recession many advanced nations have experienced an unprecedented rise in debt-to-GDP ratios. Among other factors, increasing age-related spending can add to fiscal stress with a high peacetime debt-GDP ratio. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the factors that can affect the debt dynamics. Previous literature highlights the components affecting the debt-GDP ratio as nominal interest rate, inflation, growth rate, and primary deficit/surplus. However, the contribution of these financing components was calculated without any reference to policy regimes. This paper calculates the financing components and their distribution under two regimes: “active” fiscal and “passive” monetary policy (“F”) and “active” monetary and “passive” fiscal policy (“M”) using US data between 1942 and 2017. The results show that inflation, growth rate, and primary deficit have played essential roles in affecting the debt-GDP dynamics under regime F.},

In particular, Friedman argued that monetary policy could not permanently influence the levels of real output, unemployment, or real rates of return on securities. However, Friedman did assert that a monetary authority could exert substantial control over the inflation rate, especially in the long run. The purpose of this paper is to argue that, even in an economy that satisfies monetarist assumptions, if monetary policy is interpreted as open market operations, then Friedman’s list of the things that monetary policy cannot permanently control may have to be expanded to include inflation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>},

I find that monetary policy can peg the nominal rate, and determine expected inflation. With sticky prices, monetary policy can also affect real interest rates and output, though higher interest rates raise output and then inflation. The conventional sign requires a coordinated fiscal–monetary policy contraction. I show how conventional new-Keynesian models also imply strong monetary–fiscal policy coordination to obtain the usual signs. I address theoretical controversies. A concluding section places our current regime in a broader historical context, and opines on how optimal fiscal and monetary policy will evolve in the new regime.}

  abstract={How large can debt get before triggering a crisis? Since debt is the expected present value of future primary surpluses, the answer depends on a countryâ€™s technical and political ability to raise future primary surpluses. However, countries do not raise the primary surplus to its peak and maintain the peak forever, the assumption implicit in the standard practice of setting maximum debt at the present value of the peak surplus. We estimate fiscal feedback rules for seven high-debt developed countries and find an increase in debt creates a sustained increase in the primary surplus, with the primary surplus reaching a peak in the future. Therefore, our implied debt limit is much lower than the standard measure. We estimate debt limits following the global financial crisis in 2008 and find substantial heterogeneity. We separate countries into risk categories based on fiscal space. Greece and Portugal eroded their fiscal space several years, prior to their fiscal crises, placing them in the highest risk category and predicting the crises that followed. Canada and Belgium maintained large enough fiscal space to achieve safe status. Other countries reduced fiscal space, with France and Spain eroding fiscal space in 2014, warning of future crises.},

We show analytically in a simple model how the fiscal regime generates larger and more persistent inflation than the monetary regime. In a quantitative application, we use a two-sector, two-agent New Keynesian model, situate the model economy in a COVID-19 recession, and quantify the effects of the transfer components of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. We find that the transfer multipliers are significantly larger under the fiscal regimeâ€”which results in a milder contractionâ€”than under the monetary regime, primarily because inflationary pressures of this regime counteract the deflationary forces during the recession. Moreover, redistribution produces a Pareto improvement under the fiscal regime.},

By insulating households' nominal incomes from aggregate real shocks, this policy effectively completes financial markets by stabilizing the ratio of debt to income.

abstract = {We describe a simple mechanism that generates inflation persistence in a standard sticky-price model of optimal fiscal and monetary policy. Key to this mechanism is that policies are implemented under discretion. The government's discretionary incentive to erode the real value of nominal public debt by means of surprise inflation renders inflation expectations and, in further consequence, equilibrium inflation rates highly correlated with the stock of public debt. Debt, in turn, is highly persistent, allowing for tax-smoothing in the face of disturbances. Due to the aforementioned correlation, the persistence in debt carries over to inflation. Our analysis uncovers a non-monotonic effect of nominal rigidities on inflation persistence and shows that government debt under discretion does not display the near random walk property familiar from the Ramsey literature. A calibrated version of the model that incorporates a moderate degree of monopolistic competition and price stickiness is quantitatively consistent with the inflation dynamics experienced in the USA since the Volcker disinflation of the early 1980s.}

The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

These methods are tested with data on forecasts of quarterly hog prices, both within and out of sample.

Such policy prescriptions presuppose an ability to commit. Without that ability, the temptation to use inflation surprises to offset monopoly and tax distortions, as well as to reduce the real value of government debt, creates a state-dependent inflationary bias problem. High debt levels and short-term debt exacerbate the inflation bias. But this produces a debt stabilization bias because the policy maker wishes to deviate from the tax smoothing policies typically pursued under commitment, by returning government debt to steady-state. As a result, the response to shocks in New Keynesian models can be radically different, particularly when government debt levels are high and maturity short.}

 abstract = {The study tests the fiscal theory of price determination for Pakistan's economy for the period 1970 to 2007. The evidence is less clear cut to infer that authorities are following a certain type of regime fiscal dominant or monetary dominant during the sample period. The liabilities responses negatively to the innovation in surpluses, that is in the subsequent period the liabilities decreases in face of increase in surplus. This characterises monetary dominant regime, the events that give rise to surplus innovation are likely to persist causing the rise in the future surpluses and surpluses pay-off some of the debt causing the fall in the liabilities. By analysing the behaviour of nominal GDP, an innovation in surplus reduces nominal income and decreases the level of debt in the subsequent periods, this analysis also confirms the Ricardian analysis. On the other hand, the study finds that, as predicted by the fiscal theory of price determination, the occurrence of wealth effects of change^ in nominal public debt may pass through to prices by increasing inflation variability in case of Pakistan. The implication that comes out of this study is that nominal public liabilities, as reflected either in money growth or in nominal public debt, matter for price stability in case of Pakistan. The authorities may be following different regimes for different time periods during the 1970-2007.},

Ricardian equivalence does not imply that fiscal policy is irrelevant, except in the case of a certain class of policies ("Ricardian" policies). The role of fiscal developments in inflation determination under a non- Ricardian regime is illustrated through an analysis of the bond-price support regime of the 1940s. A monetary-fiscal regime with attractive properties would combine a "Taylor rule" for monetary policy with nominal- deficit targeting as a fiscal policy commitment.},

Using a characterization of the bias–variance trade-off faced when choosing between either the recursive and rolling schemes or a scalar convex combination of the two, we derive optimal observation windows and combining weights designed to minimize mean square forecast error. Monte Carlo experiments and several empirical examples indicate that combination can often provide improvements in forecast accuracy relative to forecasts made using the recursive scheme or the rolling scheme with a fixed window width.},

 abstract = {This paper considers issues related to multiple structural changes, occurring at unknown dates, in the linear regression model estimated by least squares. The main aspects are the properties of the estimators, including the estimates of the break dates, and the construction of tests that allow inference to be made about the presence of structural change and the number of breaks. We consider the general case of a partial structural change model where not all parameters are subject to shifts. We study both fixed and shrinking magnitudes of shifts and obtain the rates of convergence for the estimated break fractions. We also propose a procedure that allows one to test the null hypothesis of, say, l changes, versus the alternative hypothesis of l + 1 changes. This is particularly useful in that it allows a specific to general modeling strategy to consistently determine the appropriate number of changes present. An estimation strategy for which the location of the breaks need not be simultaneously determined is discussed. Instead, our method successively estimates each break point.},

abstract = {Abstract In a recent paper, Bai and Perron (1998) considered theoretical issues related to the limiting distribution of estimators and test statistics in the linear model with multiple structural changes. In this companion paper, we consider practical issues for the empirical applications of the procedures. We first address the problem of estimation of the break dates and present an efficient algorithm to obtain global minimizers of the sum of squared residuals. This algorithm is based on the principle of dynamic programming and requires at most least-squares operations of order O(T2) for any number of breaks. Our method can be applied to both pure and partial structural change models. Second, we consider the problem of forming confidence intervals for the break dates under various hypotheses about the structure of the data and the errors across segments. Third, we address the issue of testing for structural changes under very general conditions on the data and the errors. Fourth, we address the issue of estimating the number of breaks. Finally, a few empirical applications are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the procedures. All methods discussed are implemented in a GAUSS program.

abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach for detecting the number of structural breaks in a time series when estimation of the breaks is performed one at the time. We consider the case of shifts in the mean of a possibly nonlinear process, allowing for dependent and heterogeneous observations. This is accomplished through a simple, sequential, almost sure rule ensuring that, in large samples, both the probabilities of overestimating and underestimating the number of breaks are zero. A new estimator for the long run variance which is consistent also in the presence of neglected breaks is proposed. The finite sample behavior is investigated via a simulation exercise. A tendency to overreject the null hypothesis emerges for sample of moderate size, and so we suggest a small sample correction. The sequential procedure, applied to the weekly Eurodollar interest rate, detects multiple breaks over the period 1973–1995.}}

 abstract = {Accumulation of debt can be seen as the resultant of the balance between cumulated primary deficits and the cumulated weighted excess of growth over interest rate. Decomposing the change in the central government's liabilities relative to GDP since 1951-52, it is seen that but for three recent years, the accretion to debt relative to GDP was due to the cumulated primary deficits. A significant part of the effect of the cumulated primary deficits could be absorbed in the sixties, seventies, and the nineties due to the excess of growth over interest rate. However, there were large unabsorbed parts in the fifties and the eighties. The cushion provided by the excess of growth over interest rate may not continue to be available for long. For three years, viz, 2000-01 to 2002-03, the interest rate exceeded the growth rate. This, together with the continuing primary deficits though at a reduced level, led to acceleration in the increase in the debt-GDP ratio in recent years. For stabilisation of the debt-GDP ratio at current or reduced levels, focus on primary balance becomes necessary.},

abstract = {The paper studies the solvency of the Indian public sector and the eventual monetization and inflation that would be implied by stabilization of the debt-GNP ratio in the absence of changes in the primary deficit. The nonstationarity of the discounted public debt suggests that indefinite continuation of the pattern of behavior reflected in the historical time-series process is inconsistent with the maintenance of solvency. This message is reinforced by the recent behavior of the debt-GNP ratio and of the ratio to GNP of the sum of the primary budget surplus and seigniorage. Our estimates of the base money demand function suggests that even maximal use of the inflation tax would not be sufficient to restore solvency. Measures to reduce the primary deficit are therefore unavoidable.}

 abstract = {How should the tax rate and the level of public debt adjust to an adverse fiscal shock? What is the optimal maturity structure of public debt? If the maturity structure is carefully chosen, the ex post variation in the market value of public debt can cover the government against the need to raise taxes or debt if fiscal conditions should turn bad. In general, almost every Arrow-Debreu allocation can be implemented with noncontingent debt of different maturities. In a stylized example, the optimal policy is implemented by selling a perpetuity and investing in a short-term asset.},

 abstract = {The fiscal theory says that the price level is determined by the ratio of nominal debt to the present value of real primary surpluses. I analyze long-term debt and optimal policy in the fiscal theory. I find that the maturity structure of the debt matters. For example, it determines whether news of future deficits implies current inflation or future inflation. When long-term debt is present, the government can trade current inflation for future inflation by debt operations; this tradeoff is not present if the government rolls over short-term debt. The maturity structure of outstanding debt acts as a "budget constraint" determining which periods' price levels the government can affect by debt variation alone. In addition, debt policy-the expected pattern of future state-contingent debt sales, repurchases and redemptions-matters crucially for the effects of a debt operation. I solve for optimal debt policies to minimize the variance of inflation. I find cases in which long-term debt helps to stabilize inflation. I also find that the optimal policy produces time series that are similar to U.S. surplus and debt time series. To understand the data, I must assume that debt policy offsets the inflationary impact of cyclical surplus shocks, rather than causing price level disturbances by policy-induced shocks. Shifting the objective from price level variance to inflation variance, the optimal policy produces much less volatile inflation at the cost of a unit root in the price level; this is consistent with the stabilization of U.S. inflation after the gold standard was abandoned.},
